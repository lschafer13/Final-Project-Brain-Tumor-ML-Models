# Final-Project-Brain-Tumor-ML-Models

///
Through the application and cross validation of multiple machine learning models, I was able to develop an algorithm that can predict with 98.67% accuracy whether or not a brain tumor is present from 13 key features from an MRI scan. The dataset that I used for training and testing was found in the Kaggle dataset library. It includes roughly 3800 entries of 15 columns. Exploring different models, such as: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and AdaBoost Classifier, I was able to determine the highest correlating features to accurately and reliably predict the target.
